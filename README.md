Observations

•	First observable trend in the data can be seen analysis of Max Temperature results. In the Max Temperature vs. Latitude scatter plot The countries above and below the equator (Latitude of 0) begin to recede in temperature the further they are away from the equator in a consistant pattern. This data is consistant with the relationship between sunlight and the equatorial cities, these areas on average recieve are more steady supply and sunlight and therefore heat regardless of seasons comparitively to cities that reside further from the equator.

"The further a location is from the equator, the less sunlight that location receives to heat the atmosphere and thus, the temperature is colder. The reason that higher latitudes receive less sunlight is due to the shape of Earth." (http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=6095)

This is hyptothesis is further strengthened with the linear regression models based on Nothern and Southern Hemispheres max temperature data points. In the Northern Hemisphere the The r² value is 0.76 showing a high level of correlation.


•	Second observable trend in the data can be seen analysis of Humidity % results. Cities on the equator set sit within 60-100% humidity when you move above and below the equator the variability of humidity % begins to spread the further away from the equator you reside. Humidity levels are affected by a variety of complex variables such as topological state of area. This trend would need to be further investigated to gain a stronger association with the latitude of the earth.

•	The third observable trend is the hotels that were filtered for ideal weather conditions. Besides the city of Rawson in Argentina the other cities sit within the same latitudinal slice of the earth. This could indicate that these particular conditions are correlated with this latitudinal position
